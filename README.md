# SQL-To-Do List

## Description

We were to create a 'To Do' application.
This application should:
<ul>
    <li>Create a front end experience that allows a user to create a Task.</li>
    <li>When the Task is created, it should be stored inside of a database (SQL)</li>
    <li>Whenever a Task is created the front end should refresh to show all tasks that need to be completed.</li>
    <li>Each Task should have an option to 'Complete' or 'Delete'.</li>
    <li>When a Task is complete, its visual representation should change on the front end. </li>
    <li>Whether or not a Task is complete should also be stored in the database.</li>
    <li>Deleting a Task should remove it both from the front end as well as the Database.</li>
    <li>Use CSS to go beyond the vanilla HTML look</li>
    <li>Use a pop-up with the delete button to make sure user wants to delete task.</li>
</ul>

## Installation
<ol>
    <li>The queries in the data.sql file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on Postgres, so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries</li>

    <li>Run npm run server in your terminal</li>
    <li>The npm run client command will open up a new browser tab for you!</li>
